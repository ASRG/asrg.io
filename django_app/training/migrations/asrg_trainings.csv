Raelize,BootPwn: Breaking Secure Boot by Experience,"Secure Boot is fundamental for assuring the authenticity of the Trusted Code Base (TCB) of secure devices. Recent attacks on Secure Boot against a wide variety of devices such as video game consoles and mobile phones, are a clear indicator that Secure Boot vulnerabilities are widespread.

Are you interested in learning and experiencing what it takes to break Secure Boot leveraging more than just software vulnerabilities?

Then, this is THE experience for you!

The BootPwn experience puts you in the attacker's seat in order to explore the attack surface of Secure Boot while identifying and exploiting interesting vulnerabilities applicable to real-world devices. The experience itself is exercise-driven and gamified using an exciting jeopardy-style Capture-The-Flag (CTF).

Using an emulated device, which is based on publicly available code bases, you will be challenged to identify and exploit interesting vulnerabilities specific to Secure Boot. Even though the emulated device implements the ARMv8 (AArch64) architecture, many exercises are at the same time architecture independent.

Do no worry if your reverse engineering or exploiting skills are rusty or non-existing. You do not need to be an software security expert nor do we aim to make you one. Nevertheless, most exercises can be completed in various ways which are interesting for experiences attendees as well. Moreover, hardware attacks like Fault Injection, which are a very relevant threat for Secure Boot, are discussed and simulated where possible.",2420,EUR,4 days of 4 hours,,Virtual / Online,https://raelize.com/bootpwn/,,
Raelize,TEEPwn: Breaking TEEs by Experience,"It's notoriously hard to secure a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) due to the interaction between complex hardware and a large trusted code base (TCB). The security provided by TEEs has been broken on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones, smart TVs and even vehicles. Publicly disclosed TEE vulnerabilities were often exploited directly from the less-trusted Rich Execution Environment (REE). Many of these vulnerabilities were speandcific for TEEs and required novel exploitation techniques.

The TEEPwn experience provides an offensive system-level perspective and dives into the darker corners of TEE Security. It is designed with a system-level approach, where you will experience powerful exploitation of TEE vulnerabilities. The TEEPwn experience is hands-on, gamified and driven by an exciting jeopardy-style Capture the Flag (CTF).

Your journey starts by achieving a comprehensive understanding of TEEs, where you will learn how hardware and software concur to enforce effective security boundaries. You will then use this understanding for identifying interesting vulnerabilities across the entire TEE attack surface. You will then be challenged along the path to exploit them in multiple scenarios. All vulnerabilities are identified and exploited on our emulated attack platform which implements an ARMv8 (64-bit) TEE based on ARM TrustZone.

You will take on different roles, as an attacker in control of:

- the REE, attempting to achieve privileged code execution in the TEE.
- the REE, trying to access assess protected by a Trusted Application (TA).
- a TA, aiming to escalate privileges to TEE OS.
- a TA, accessing the protected assets of other TAs.

TEEPwn will guide you into an unexpected range of attack vectors and TEE-specific exploitation techniques, which may be leveraged for novel and creative software exploits. refining your skills to a new level.",2420,EUR,4 days of 4 hours,,Virtual / Online,https://raelize.com/teepwn/,,
ringzer0,Embedded Automotive Security: A Hands-on Introduction,"This training is geared towards offensive security researchers who want to dip their toes into the field of automotive security. We will use developments boards to give the attendees a practical introduction to bus systems such as CAN, LIN and FlexRay and show them how modern ECUs are developed.

In contrast to other trainings, we will not look into infotainment units as we see them as too similar to other embededded and mobile systems. Rather we will concentrate on the specifics of automotive embedded systems. To help with this process we will show the attendees how to emulate systems to be faster in assessing them. After taking this training, the attendees will have developed a thorough understanding of the AUTOSAR architecture and development processes, be able to independently evaluate the security of ECUs and find vulnerabilities in them.",4000,USD,4 days,,Virtual,https://ringzer0.training/automotive-security.html,,

Therefore, engineers should ensure that systems are designed free of unreasonable risks to motor vehicle safety, including those that may result due to existence of potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The automotive industry is making vehicle cybersecurity an organizational priority. Prioritizing vehicle cybersecurity also means learning about vehicle hacking techniques in order to ensure that systems will be reasonably safe under expected real-world conditions, including those that may arise due to potential vehicle cybersecurity vulnerabilities from hacking the CAN communications or OBD-II interface. The automotive cybersecurity environment is dynamic and is expected to change continually and, at times, rapidly.
