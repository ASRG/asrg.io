# ASRG Member Portal

The objective of the ASRG member portal is to provide a central place for members, chapter leads, region leads, and others to access information. Namely:
- Create an ASRG account.
- Meetup-like functionality to facilitate local events around the world. Ideally, we will utilize "Chapter" by FreeCodeCamp (https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/chapter) as the mechanism to schedule/remind/organize/etc. At minimum, we need the following functionalities:
  - View local events (and see what else is going on at ASRG chapters globally!)
  - Register for a local event.
  - Register for a global event.
  - Post events.
- Access global information, including webinars.
