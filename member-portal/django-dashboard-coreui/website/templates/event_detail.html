            <h3>"Vehicle Cybersecurity Trends: A Technical Deep Dive of Recent Incidents"</h3>
            Every major OEM worldwide has recognized the need for a Vehicle SOC (VSOC), driven by the drastic increase
            in
            cybersecurity-related incidents in the industry. This is only going to accelerate as Autonomous, Connected
            and
            Electric (ACE) vehicles become more prevalent, providing more advanced services, while simultaneously
            increasing their attack surface. We will explore recent trends in vehicular cyber-security through deep
            technical dives into recently publicly reported incidents, as well as exploring examples of undisclosed
            0-day
            vectors.
